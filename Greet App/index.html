    /*
    
    For faster execution wrap the script in a fucntion and it will not execute it untill and unless it is called
    Therefore only funcition is loaded in memeory and it doesn't slow the website
    Or use 'defer' which make script load after loading the whole html page.
    defer – lazy loads the script. i.e. it doesn’t loads until the entire page is loaded.
    this way we donot have to put script below </head> tag

    Without the defer the scripts 'Eager Loads'

    Other keyword is 'async' -Scripts Runs parallely but it should not be dependent to the page
    Only use aysnc with independent scripts
    With async the task of loading the script is given to another Thread that sole's purpose is for the loding of the script

    Synchronization - Blocks the below code and doesn't let unless the present code is loaded
    Thread - Code in execution
